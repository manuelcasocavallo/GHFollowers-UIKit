# GitHub Followers App - UIKit

This app is part of Sean Allen's Take Home Project course.

GitHub Followers is an app that uses the GitHub API to fetch all the followers of a certain user and show some informations about that user.
The app follows the MVC pattern, is developed entirely in UIKit and without any 3rd part library. The UI is done 100% in code (no storyboard) and focuses on reusable components.
